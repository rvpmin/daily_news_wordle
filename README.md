# 📰 Daily News Wordle - Wordle with Real Articles

This project is a Wordle-style guessing game where the player must guess a five-letter word, **extracted from a real New York Times article**. The game updates daily, and each level corresponds to a different article. After each round, the player sees the article's title, abstract, and a link to the original.

##  Key Features

- **Real-word targets**: All target words are sourced from NYT articles (World section).
-  **Daily game**: A new game is generated each day, either automatically or manually from the admin panel.
-  **Multiple levels per game**: Each daily game includes 5 levels, each based on a different article.
-  **Integrated hints**: After finishing a level, the title, abstract, and original link are revealed.
-  **Session-based state**: Game progress is saved using `request.session`, with no login required.

## ⚙️ Project Structure

### Core Models

- `Article`: Stores metadata from a NYT article, including the title, abstract, URL, and target word.
- `DailyGame`: Represents the game for a specific day. Contains multiple `GameArticle` entries.
- `GameArticle`: Intermediate model connecting `DailyGame` to specific articles, assigning a level number.
- `WordleGame` and `GameLevel`: More flexible models for manual control through the Wagtail admin interface.

### Main Components

- `utils.py`: Contains functions for:
  -  Fetching articles from the NYT API.
  -  Extracting valid 5-letter words.
  -  Evaluating guesses and handling game logic.
- `views.py`: Contains views for:
  -  Displaying the homepage and today’s game.
  -  Validating guesses (`check_guess`).
  -  Forcing game creation (`force_create_game`).
  -  Rendering individual game levels.

##  How It Works

1. **Fetch articles**: Calls the NYT API (`/world.json`) to get the latest articles.
2. **Word extraction**: Extracts five-letter words from article content (title, abstract, etc.).
3. **Game creation**: Builds a `DailyGame` object with selected articles.
4. **Gameplay**:
   - The player sees a level number and enters guesses.
   - Feedback is shown (correct, present, or missing letters).
   - After winning or losing, the original article metadata is displayed.
